This repository contains a collective document of clustering algorithms, clustering initialization methods and clustering performance/validation measurements. The initial material was obtained from my Ph.D. thesis (citation pending!) and my publications:

- ["An empirical comparison between stochastic and deterministic centroid initialisation for K-Means variations."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09946)
- ["A semi-supervised sparse K-Means algorithm."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865520304268)

I hope to update this material with new techniques using a similar/unified notation style. All the techniques presented here are accompanied by relevant bibliography.
